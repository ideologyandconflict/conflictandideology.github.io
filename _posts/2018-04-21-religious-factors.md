## How ISIS rationalize their violence using religion?

### 1. THE POWER OF RELIGION: PROVIDE JUSTIFICATION
“Only religious faith is a strong enough force to motivate such utter madness in otherwise sane and decent people (Dawkins, 2006)”
-Richard Dawkins, Author of “The God Delusion”

### 2. QURAN contains verses that has to be understood under certain context; failure to know the history behind will lead to misconception/ misinterpretation
“A majority of Muslims claim to understand Islam, and in trying to do so, they have divided themselves into more than 73 divisions (AlGohar, 2017).”
-Younus AlGohar, Author of Mysterious Horizons – Beyond God

### 3. ISIS deliberately manipulated some quotes, so as to justify their actions
“ISIS utilizes every opportunity to manipulate information for their own benefit (Ali, 2015).”
-Mah-Rukh Ali, Author of “The threat from IS”, 2015

_When the [four] forbidden months are over, wherever you encounter the idolaters, kill them, seize them, besiege them, wait for them at every lookout post; but if they turn [to God], maintain the prayer, and pay the prescribed alms, let them go on their way, for God is most forgiving and merciful.  (Qu’ran 9:5)_

### 4. Together with the power of religion’s justification, Mujahids now equipped with moral licenses and are ready to carry out sacred mission, and execute religious violence
“...[ISIS] can justify their acts by citing the Quran, then it becomes easier for them as it adds moral and religious immunity and they avoid condemnation (Freamon, 2015)” 
Bernard K. Freamon, Professor of Law at Seton Hall University 


### 5. In short, “Customized” Religious ideology LEGITIMIZES ISIS’s violence, though it doesn’t cause it
“It’s not ISIS’s interpretation of Islamic texts that drives its brutality—it’s the group’s desired brutality driving its interpretation of the texts (Mogahed, as cited in Cottee, 2016).”
