### -Religion itself may not be evil, but ISIS have manipulated quotes from the religious text.


### -How the ISIS use religion to justify/rationalize their violence(or other generally unaccepted behavior). Example of justifying violence: beheading, burning people alive; Quran, which is a critical religious text for Muslim, contains some 109 verses, if being “misinterpreted”, can become encouragement to believers to establish violent war against the non-believers


### Verse 1:
_“…But if they should repent, **establish prayer, and give zakat**, let them [go] on their
way. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.” (The Qur’an 9:5)_

### Verse 2:
_“**And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection**, then grant him
protection **so that he may hear the words of Allah**. Then deliver him to his place of
safety. **That is because they are a people who do not know**.” (The Qur’an 9:6)_

### Verse 3:
_“How can there be for the polytheists a treaty in the sight of Allah and with His
Messenger, except for those with whom you made a treaty at al-Masjid al-
Haram? **So as long as they are upright toward you, be upright toward them.
Indeed, Allah loves the righteous** [who fear Him].” (The Qur’an 9:7)_

### Verse 4: 
_“…So if they withdraw from you, and fight not against you, and offer you peace, then
**Allah has opened no way for you against them**.”(The Qur’an 9:40)_

### Verse 5: 
_“But if they desist, then lo! **Allah is Forgiving, Merciful**. And fight them until
persecution is no more, and religion is for Allah. But if they desist, then **let there be
no hostility except against wrong-doers**.” (The Qur’an 2:192-193)_

**In fact, the Qur’an do not suggest violence if peace can be brought instead. God is so
benevolent that none of the non-Muslims should be killed because they may become a
Muslin in the future, if they can live peacefully with Muslims (The Qur’an 9:5-6). It should be
cited that God hopes that the hostility should be minimized and wars should end whenever
possible (The Qur’an 2:193). The ideas of peace and forgiving should be consider before
initiating wars and violence is conditional that should not be easily waged.**
