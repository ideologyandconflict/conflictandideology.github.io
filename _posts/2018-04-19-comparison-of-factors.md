## Factors can be further classified into two categories:

### 1. Fundamental(Roots):

- The fundamental factor, could be the human nature (the unlimited desire for expansion/obtain maximum resources/live a stable life) such socio-economic factors are more fundamental(Root)
- Religion may NOT be the fundamental factor, but rather, as a reason/excuse/PR term for authorities to make sense of their generally unacceptable violent actions.

### 2. Sustaining factors(fuels)

- In terms of sustaining factors, Religion is the strongest factor in sustaining & intensifying conflicts, since it was an encouragement & justifications for their violent acts(i. e. a strong fuel to persist chaos)
