## 1. Political instability: (Competition between ISIS and Al Qaeda)

- ISIS expand his territory into Syria during the Syria War, but the movement of such did not consult the leader of Al-Nusra Front (JN), a division of Al Qaeda

- ISIS leader announced the rivalry between ISIS and Al Qaeda, and a caliphate and they compete for the leadership of Jihadist Movement(Examples of rivalry)

### Why are ISIS and Al Qaeda disputing each other?
Tracing back to 2013, the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi notified that he was
expanding the Islamic State of Iraq to Syria, without consulting Al-Nusra Front (JN)
and Al Qaeda and transforming the group name to the Islamic State of Iraq and Al
Sham, claiming that ISIS and Al-Nusra Front were in one body. This has triggered
overwhelming hatred of Abu Muhammad al-Jawlani, the head of JN. Then he
rejected the approach on Syria and declared his loyalty to Zawahiri, leader of Al
Qaeda. Though Zawahiri made effort to demand ISIS to retreat from Syria, it ended
in vein. Baghdadi even broadcasted a message that the rivalry between ISIS and Al
Qaeda and would not follow any division, and eventually the two groups are
separated. After Baghdadi detachment and announced a caliphate, the jihadist
movement has turned in fractional, the two groups compete the leadership of the
jihadist movement with each other.

### The ways they behave violence between ISIS and Al Qaeda
Al Qaeda launched enormous attacks in landmarks. The notorious example will be
the attacked on the World Trade Center on 9/11. Driven by insanity, however, Al
Qaeda would put a halt on murdering westerners when its goal is reached. For
instance, Al Qaeda allowed western journalists to conduct interview with them, since
Al Qaeda believe that terrorism would not function if it is not in the limelight. It
hoped to spread its message to the globe. On the other hand, the ISIS emerged from
civil war of Iraq and Syria. Using heavy and destructive weapons as a force is what they believe in to conquer or establish new Islamic world. They deem terrorism as a
means, as war of revolution of religion and ideology.

### Example of Competition between ISIS and Al Qaeda on a violence basis
After the crisis of hotel in Mali launched by the Al Qaeda, in which 19 people were
killed, there were aggressive debate between ISIS and Al Qaeda. Supporter of Al
Qaeda suggested ISIS that might 'learn a thing or two' from the Mali Incident. Some
said,' Allahu alam', meaning that 'God knows best', and some commented ' they
(ISIS) don't operate in Mali, we know who operate there (Al Qaeda)'. All these
sarcastic wordings induced ISIS momentum on violence, they could not be
humiliated. Shortly after a week of the Mali Crisis, the ISIS attacked Paris where 130
people were killed. This move has illustrated how fierce competition between two
terrorist parties.

## 2. Economic factors:

Oil fields, taxation/extortion on people, kidnapping for ransom, wealthy donors, sales of antiquities, Seization of Iraqi bank, sales of other looted property, real estate, agriculture etc.
