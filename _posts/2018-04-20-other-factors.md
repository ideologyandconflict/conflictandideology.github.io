## 1. Political instability: 

Iraq and Syria had severe bad political instability, ISIS uses its opportunistic ways to engulf the chaotic regions, and slowly develops into terrorism.

Considering Syria, the unrest was triggered by "Arab Spring" incident. Many citizens were in opposition to the regime under president Assad. Confrontation between government and military opposition is taking place.

The UN force accompanied by Britain and France entered the regional crisis in 2013. Until 2015, Russia claimed to devastate ISIS but actually striking anti-Assad camp secretly. And the US President Donald Trump launched a missile attack on an airbase due to the fact that storage of chemical weapons by Syrian government air force and start her journey in this messy crisis. 

The separated actions of different nation escalate the situation, and since the state was out of dominating ruling power and lacked national defense. ISIS declared "caliphate" ranging from Aleppo to eastern Iraqi province of Diyala in June 2014.

## 2. Rivalry between ISIS and Al-Qaeda: 

### What is the philosophy of Al Qaeda?
Al Qaeda put emphasis on combating the distanced enemy 'USA', since it reckons
the US is a repressive regime within the Muslim kingdom. Moreover, the extreme
target of Al Qaeda is to remove spoiled 'apostate' powers in the Middle East and
substitute them with real Islamic governments. Why would Al Qaeda strategy
approach on the US? It is because the US Government constantly give financial and
military aids to incapable rulers in the Middle East, such as the head of Saudi Arabia
and Egypt. Al Qaeda uses terrorism to excite Muslims to follow its belief. Only if the
US retreat its dominance or influence, the regimes in Middle East would be fragile
enough to be overthrown.

### What is the doctrine of ISIS?
Unlike Al Qaeda, it does not primarily focus on the far enemies, but rather the
'surrounding enemy' in terms of a regional level. It hopes to resist the betrayers in
the Arab Kingdom, such as the Assad regime in Syria and Abadi regime in Iraq. ISIS
strike to construct an Islamic state to fulfil its ideology: Establishing a government in
which Muslims could exist under the law of Islam. Only when found an Islamic
Kingdom, Muslims can be attracted to join the ideology. Only by capturing more
lands, it can develop a powerful army for engulfing more territories.

### Why are ISIS and Al Qaeda disputing each other?
Tracing back to 2013, the leader of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi notified that he was
expanding the Islamic State of Iraq to Syria, without consulting Al-Nusra Front (JN)
and Al Qaeda and transforming the group name to the Islamic State of Iraq and Al
Sham, claiming that ISIS and Al-Nusra Front were in one body. This has triggered
overwhelming hatred of Abu Muhammad al-Jawlani, the head of JN. Then he
rejected the approach on Syria and declared his loyalty to Zawahiri, leader of Al
Qaeda. Though Zawahiri made effort to demand ISIS to retreat from Syria, it ended
in vein. Baghdadi even broadcasted a message that the rivalry between ISIS and Al
Qaeda and would not follow any division, and eventually the two groups are
separated. After Baghdadi detachment and announced a caliphate, the jihadist
movement has turned in fractional, the two groups compete the leadership of the
jihadist movement with each other.

### The ways they behave violence between ISIS and Al Qaeda
Al Qaeda launched enormous attacks in landmarks. The notorious example will be
the attacked on the World Trade Center on 9/11. Driven by insanity, however, Al
Qaeda would put a halt on murdering westerners when its goal is reached. For
instance, Al Qaeda allowed western journalists to conduct interview with them, since
Al Qaeda believe that terrorism would not function if it is not in the limelight. It
hoped to spread its message to the globe. On the other hand, the ISIS emerged from
civil war of Iraq and Syria. Using heavy and destructive weapons as a force is what they believe in to conquer or establish new Islamic world. They deem terrorism as a
means, as war of revolution of religion and ideology.

### Example of Competition between ISIS and Al Qaeda on a violence basis
After the crisis of hotel in Mali launched by the Al Qaeda, in which 19 people were
killed, there were aggressive debate between ISIS and Al Qaeda. Supporter of Al
Qaeda suggested ISIS that might 'learn a thing or two' from the Mali Incident. Some
said,' Allahu alam', meaning that 'God knows best', and some commented ' they
(ISIS) don't operate in Mali, we know who operate there (Al Qaeda)'. All these
sarcastic wordings induced ISIS momentum on violence, they could not be
humiliated. Shortly after a week of the Mali Crisis, the ISIS attacked Paris where 130
people were killed. This move has illustrated how fierce competition between two
terrorist parties.

## 3. Economic factors:

### How do ISIS obtain constant funding to sustain the war?
Oil fields, taxation/extortion on people, kidnapping for ransom, wealthy donors, sales of antiquities, Seization of Iraqi bank, sales of other looted property, real estate, agriculture etc.
